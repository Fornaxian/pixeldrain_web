			Hi! {referral} wants you to sponsor their pixeldrain account. This
			will give them â‚¬0.01 every day in pixeldrain prepaid credit. They
			can use this credit to get a discount on their file storage and
			sharing costs. Here is a short summary of what this entails:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Sponsoring only works while you have an active subscription
				plan. When your subscription deactivates the creator will no
				longer receive commissions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pixeldrain credit cannot be cashed out. So they are not earning
				real money with this.
			</li>
			<li>
				This does not cost you any extra money. The commissions paid out
				to the creator are paid for by pixeldrain itself.
			</li>
			<li>
				You can change who you are sponsoring at any time on your <a
				href="/user/settings">account settings page</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you want to know more about the affiliate program check out
				the <a href="/about#toc_12">Q&A page</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If you click 'Accept' then the requested affiliate code will be
			added to your account and the creator will start earning. If you
			choose 'Deny' then we will never show this pop-up again.
		</p>
