# Content policy

[TOC]

## Disallowed contents

The following types of content are not allowed to be shared on pixeldrain. They
will be removed when reported.

* **Copyright violation** - Works which are shared without permission from the
  copyright holder. For copyright reports we need a formal DMCA takedown request
  originating from the copyright holder or a representative. See the chapter
  [E-Mail reporting rules](#toc_2) below. When sending a copyright infringement
  notice to our abuse address, please state clearly that it is a copyright
  infringement notice so that we can properly detect the type of report. Using
  words like "theft" or "stolen" won't be detected because they are too vague.

* **Abuse of minors** - Videos, images or audio fragments depicting abuse or
  inappropriate touching of minors will be removed. Users uploading this type of
  content will receive a permanent account and IP address ban.

* **Zoophilia** - Videos, images or audio depicting abuse or inappropriate
  touching of animals.

* **Terrorism** - Videos, images or audio fragments which promote and glorify
  acts of terrorism. This category is only for material which promotes
  terrorism. Material which shows terrorism (torture, murder) should be reported
  under the _gore_ category.

* **Gore** - Graphic and shocking videos or images depicting severe harm to
  humans (or animals).

* **Malware and computer viruses** - Software programs designed to cause harm to
  computer systems. Please attach some proof that the file actually contains
  malware, like a VirusTotal scan result. If no proof is provided then we will
  assume the report is invalid.

* **Doxing** - Publishing private information about individuals or
  organisations. This includes publicly sharing address information, ID scans or
  login credentials which are not supposed to be public. Please [read about what
  doxing really means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing) before filing a
  report in this category. If the file is content that you produce and sell,
  then it does not fall under the doxing category. In that case you should file
  a copyright claim.

* **Revenge porn** - The distribution of sexually explicit images or videos of
  individuals without their consent. This category _does not apply_ for material
  which is sold online for money. In that case you should file a copyright
  claim. Please [read about what revenge porn really
  means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_porn) before filing a report in
  this category.

Violating these rules will result in your IP address being banned from uploading
to pixeldrain.

If you have found content which falls in any of these categories on pixeldrain
please report it by sending an e-mail to
[abuse@pixeldrain.com](mailto:abuse@pixeldrain.com). Please state clearly in
which category the content falls, and don't forget to include a link to the
content itself in the e-mail. When reporting links through e-mail pay attention
to the rules described below.

## E-Mail reporting rules

Pixeldrain's abuse handling process has been largely automated. Messages sent to
[abuse@pixeldrain.com](mailto:abuse@pixeldrain.com) are automatically scanned
for pixeldrain links and processed. The first report we receive from a sender is
manually reviewed. If the report is approved then your e-mail address will be
added to our whitelist and all following messages are processed automatically.
For this to work efficiently we have to set some requirements on the mails we
receive:

* Messages are categorized based on their contents. Make sure the report
  contains a description of the type of content and that it mentions one of the
  abuse categories listed above. The abuse mailbox only accepts reports written
  in English.

* Do not add attachments to your e-mail reports. Only the e-mail body is checked
  for download links. The message scanning system will not check your
  attachments, download links within the attached files are not detected.

* Do not obfuscate the pixeldrain links. The reported download links need to be
  complete and valid.

* The e-mail must include a
  [Message-ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-ID) header. The Message-ID
  is used to reference messages in our system, mails without a Message-ID are
  not processed.

* The abuse system uses e-mail addresses for authentication so we need to be
  wary of [message spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing). To
  combat this we require both
  [DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) and
  [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) validation before
  we can accept e-mails. If either of these checks fail we assume the message
  was spoofed and it goes straight to the spambox. If your message is vulnerable
  to spoofing then the bot will not reply to your message because we don't want
  to send e-mails to spoofed addresses.

* Only send abuse reports to
  [abuse@pixeldrain.com](mailto:abuse@pixeldrain.com). Messages sent to any
  other e-mail address are ignored.

* Do not repeatedly send reports about files which have already been removed in
  the past. We will block your e-mail address if this happens.

If your abuse report is rejected for one of the above reasons then you will
receive a reply with instructions on how to fix it.

## Police requests

In the case of official police investigations, pixeldrain can share user
details when requested. Please send all police data requests to
[police@pixeldrain.com](mailto:police@pixeldrain.com).

* E-mail address of user

The severity and sensitivity of the request will be chosen at our own
discretion. In cases where the request is considered not serious or unlawful, we
reserve the right to deny the request for information.
