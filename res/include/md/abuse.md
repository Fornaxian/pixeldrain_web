# Content policy

The following types of content are not allowed to be shared on pixeldrain. They
will be removed when reported.

* **Copyright violation**: Works which are shared without permission from the
  copyright holder. For copyright reports we need a formal DMCA takedown request
  originating from the copyright holder or a representative. If your request is
  not valid it will be ignored. Takedown requests which are sent to any other
  address than abuse@pixeldrain.com will also be ignored. See the chapter
  [Copyright infringement](#copyright-infringement) below.
* **Porn**: Pornographic material is not strictly banned on pixeldrain. But in
  order to comply with international regulations I have to prevent it from
  spreading too far. For this reason pornographic videos and images can be
  reported through the file reporting form. Once reported the file will be
  removed from public viewing.
* **Abuse of minors**: Videos, images or audio fragments depicting abuse or
  inappropriate touching of minors will be removed and reported to the National
  Center for Missing and Exploited Children when found.
* **Zoophilia**: Videos, images or audio depicting abuse or inappropriate
  touching of animals.
* **Terrorism**: Videos, images or audio fragments which promote and
  glorify acts of terrorism.
* **Gore**: Graphic and shocking videos or images depicting severe harm to
  humans (or animals). I will clarify that I am not strictly against shocking
  content, and it is also not illegal in most places. When a shocking video goes
  viral it often ends up in the wrong places and it can cause mental issues for
  unsuspecting viewers. For that reason I will remove it when it gets reported.
* **Malware and computer viruses**: Software designed to cause harm to computer
  systems.
* **Doxing**: Posting private information about an individual or organisation.
  This includes publicly sharing private photos, videos or documents. Shaming
  and extortion are not accepted.
* **Revenge porn**: The distribution of sexually explicit images or videos of
  individuals without their consent

Violating these rules will result in your IP address being banned from uploading
to pixeldrain.

If you have found content which falls in any of these categories on pixeldrain
please report it _using the report button on the download page_ of the file. Do
not send an e-mail, it will be ignored. When a file has received enough reports
of the same type it will automatically be blocked. I will also manually review
reported files occasionally.

## Copyright infringement

If you have found content which infringes on your copyright you can send a
formal DMCA take-down request to
[abuse@pixeldrain.com](mailto:abuse@pixeldrain.com) and I will review it. In
your e-mail you need to swear under penalty of perjury that you (or your
company) own exclusive rights to the claimed content. Please state the name of
your organisation so the report can be properly categorised. Please put all
relevant information in the e-mail body itself, **no attachments**! PDF files
will not be reviewed.

The abuse mailbox relies on e-mail forwarding to work. The mail is first
processed by the pixeldrain server and then forwarded to my mailbox. If your
sending e-mail server has an
[SPF policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework#FAIL_and_forwarding)
which restricts forwarding your message will not arrive in my inbox.

Abuse mails from repeated senders are automatically processed. This only works
if you send the reports to abuse@pixeldrain.com. Do **not** send abuse reports
to support, sales or any other e-mail address, your report will be ignored or
delayed.
